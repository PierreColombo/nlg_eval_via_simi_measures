## Goal :

This repository deals with differential and entropy estimation with application to Computer Vision and NLP. The new estimator proposed in this paper can be used to train neural networks. 


## Overview

We start by giving an overview of the proposed estimates.

### Differential Entropy Estimation


### Mutual Information Estimation



This statistical measure has been tested on Data2text and Summarization.
